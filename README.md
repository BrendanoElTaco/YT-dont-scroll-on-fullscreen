# WheelLock for YouTube Fullscreen

A lightweight Firefox extension that blocks accidental mouse-wheel input while YouTube videos are in fullscreen.

This is especially useful if you are gaming, multitasking on a second monitor, or using your mouse wheel while a fullscreen YouTube video is open and YouTube starts showing overlays or suggested content from unintended scroll input.

## Install

[Get WheelLock for YouTube Fullscreen on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wheellock-for-youtube/)

## Features

- Blocks mouse-wheel input only while YouTube is in fullscreen
- Leaves normal scrolling untouched outside fullscreen
- Runs only on YouTube pages
- Lightweight and focused
- No tracking
- No data collection
- No background scripts

## Why this exists

When a YouTube video is fullscreen, accidental mouse-wheel input can trigger unwanted fullscreen UI behavior, overlays, or suggested content.

That is especially annoying when using multiple monitors or when a game does not fully keep the mouse locked to the active window.

WheelLock prevents that by intercepting wheel input only when fullscreen playback is active on supported YouTube pages.

## How it works

The extension runs as a content script on YouTube pages and checks whether the page is currently using the browser Fullscreen API.

When fullscreen is active on a supported YouTube video page, the extension blocks mouse-wheel events before they can trigger unwanted scrolling behavior or overlays.

## Supported pages

- Standard YouTube watch pages
- Shorts
- Live pages

## Privacy

WheelLock for YouTube Fullscreen does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data.

It runs locally in the browser and only on YouTube pages.

## Temporary installation for testing

You can still load the extension temporarily in Firefox for local testing:

1. Open Firefox
2. Go to about:debugging
3. Click This Firefox
4. Click Load Temporary Add-on
5. Select the extension's manifest.json

This temporary install will be removed when Firefox restarts.

## Development

### Edit and test locally

1. Make your code changes
2. Open about:debugging in Firefox
3. Reload the temporary add-on
4. Test on a YouTube video in fullscreen
